I am Gunwant, also mostly aliased everywhere as `wantguns`.  
I am software engineer with interests in distributed systems, infrastructure,
system design and backend engineering. You'll usually find me hacking my
personal server fleet or learning something new. Sometimes I write blogs on my
debugging expeditions with little new to learn.
